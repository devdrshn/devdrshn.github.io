## Event Details
* **Organizer:** IEEE SB NSSCE - IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY. 
* **Date:** 27 September 2025

## Hackathon
* **The Event:** Encrypta is a flagship event of IEEE SB NSSCE, in this event participants are provided a set of cryptic problems to which they have to find solutions via programming. 
* **What I gained:** 
I chose python as my programming language. The real world application nature of the problems provided me a valuable sneak peek into real world applications of programming. 
The entire process of building a solution from scratch and obtaining the output from the concepts I have learned from courses was extremely satisfying. This Hackathon motivated me to explore and study programming in more depth.
* **Beyond the Code:**
Second part of the event consisted of a talk session by Rakesh Ravi, Mentor IEEE SB NSSCE. Afterwards, a Group Discussion on the Effects of AI Integration in Tech was organized providing me an exposure to GDs and effective speaking.
