## Event Details
* **Organizer:** SAE NSSCE AND FLYTUTOR RPTO

## Highlights
The workshop was conducted in two halves where the first half of the workshop consisted of going over the legal frameworks of drone operation in India and the theoretical concepts and electronics working behind the scenes. And in the second part we had the chance to build a small drone ourselves. This workshop gave me an insight into embedded systems in aviation.
