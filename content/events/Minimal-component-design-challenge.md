## Event Details
* **Organizer:** IEEE PELS SBC NSSCE & IEEE IES SBC JECC. 
* **Date:** 24 August 2025

## My Entry
As part of my submission, I designed a Motion Aided Traffic Signal (MATS) system that automatically turns on only when a vehicle is detected, thereby increasing power efficiency of traffic lights in remote areas. This event gave me a chance to experiment with minimal electronic circuits by using circuit building tools like Tinkercad.
